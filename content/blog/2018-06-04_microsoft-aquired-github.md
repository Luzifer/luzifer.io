So probably everyone reading this already noticed that [Github was / will be acquired by Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/) and I'm not quite sure what to think about this so this is more like a brain-dump than anything else...

I'm an active user of Github for several years now and I'm quite happy with the possibilities there. Also I do have a bunch of tools related to and working with Github. On the other side I've turned my back towards Microsoft quite a long time ago (yeah except for the usual: my gaming pc still runs Windows). In the past for me Microsoft wasn't really associated with good products and/or decisions.

Reading the comments on Twitter regarding this acquisition a lot of comments are like "That's it! I'm moving to GitLab!" while others are defending Microsoft, stating they've changed a lot in the last 5 years and everyone being against the acquisition clearly thinks about the Microsoft of 5 years ago.

I've seen a lot of cool stuff people working for Microsoft are doing and I do see contributions to projects I'm also using: So they indeed seem to care about open source projects - which is the main aspect of the people defending Microsoft mentioned above. On the other side I've seen several projects (Sunrise calendar, Wunderlist, ...) being acquired and then simply burned down.

So do I need to be worried about this acquisition? Will Github get crappy within the next - lets say one year? Do I need to move all my projects to another platform and if so: which one? In the end I've already tried some of them (BitBucket / GitLab) and was really unsatisfied. Maybe I should go the way other - mainly bigger - open source projects are going: Setting up my own platform (maybe using Gitea) to host my repositories...

Having sorted my thoughts a bit I'm clearly not any step further: I think I'll have to wait for some time seeing what Microsoft is doing with/to Github and meanwhile thinking about a mirror of my repos in an own service and preparing an exit-strategy in case those who are raging against the acquisition are right and Microsoft ruins Github...
