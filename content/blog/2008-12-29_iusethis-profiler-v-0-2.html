Thanks to <a href="http://highearthorbit.com/">Andrew Turner</a> there is a new version of the iUseThis_Profiler available. The new version has an improvement to ask the user whether to send an application or not. After collecting the applications and widgets the user is asked to confirm on every application if he wants to send it to his profile. Also he can answer 'a' to send all applications and get rid of the ~200 following questions ;)</p><p>The script is available at the same place again: <a href="http://github.com/Luzifer/kscripts/tree/master/iusethis_profiler.rb">GitHub</a>
