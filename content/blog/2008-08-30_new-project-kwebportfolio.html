Today I had a new idea for a project and then it was started.</p><p>This time it is (as usual) a web based project. This project is intended to help you to show your work portfolio. This could be used for example to show your past work to the manager of a company you want to work for.</p><p>Until now the project is in earliest development state and not usable. The git-repository is available at <a href="http://github.com/Luzifer/kbuchhaltung/tree/master">github</a>. More news about this project will be posted here and every commit into the project is posted to <a href="http://friendfeed.com/luzifer">friendfeed</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/Luzifer">twitter</a>.
