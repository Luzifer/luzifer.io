Just a few minutes ago I released a new version of my KNopaste. The new version got the version number 3.4.1 and is - as usual - available via <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/knopaste/knopaste-rev-3.4.1.zip">download</a> from the sourceforge servers.</p><p>The changes in this version are limited to a new version of the GeSHi highlight engine. They released version 1.0.8 yesterday with some bug fixes, a faster engine and nine new supported languages. So if you were missing your favorite language at my KNopaste you might be happy after looking at the new version.</p><p>Other archive formats than the linked zip file are available at the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=174124&amp;package_id=199604&amp;release_id=618831">download page</a> since this new version.</p><p>If you watch some bugs crawling through my application please use the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=174124&amp;atid=868034">bug-tracker</a> at sourceforge to let me know about them. I'll hunt and kill them after receiving your report.
