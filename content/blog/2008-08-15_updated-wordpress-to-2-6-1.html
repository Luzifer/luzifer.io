Today I got the notice that there is a new version 2.6.1 of Wordpress. While I am using an stable SVN version this update was as easy as the previous ones but every time I have to look up the command to do this. If you have the same problem this little script can help you. Simply copy it into your blog-directory and execute it with the new version as first parameter.</p><p>As usual I don't give any warranty for this script. It works for me but it might fail on your server. So please read it first and try to understand what it does. Thank you.</p><p>Download here: <a href="http://github.com/Luzifer/kscripts/blob/master/wordpress_upgrade.sh">GitHub</a>
