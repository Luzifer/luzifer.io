As the new version of Wordpress was released today I've just upgraded my blog to the new version too.</p><p>Now I still don't see many changes but the screencast of wordpress.com looks really fine. You can watch it <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/07/wordpress-26-tyner/">here</a>. The only thing I noticed is that my admin-theme "Leopard Admin" doesn't work any longer because of bugs in the design.
