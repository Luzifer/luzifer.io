If you have this issue while adding your blog to technorati:
<blockquote>The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
The proxy server could not handle the request POST /account/blogs/claimchoices.</p><p>Reason: Error reading from remote server</p><p>Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Apache Server at<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.technorati.com/">www.technorati.com</a>Port 80</blockquote>
You might be able to solve this issue by not using a proxy server to claim your blog. On my site this error disappeared just after switching off my Privoxy.
