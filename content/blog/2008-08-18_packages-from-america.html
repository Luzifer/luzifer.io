Today I received my book about Shoes ordered at Lulu publishing. As you might know Lulu ships the books from the USA so I got the chance to receive my first package with a green label from the german tax group. Some snapshots of it after the break.</p><p><!--more--></p><p>At first a snapshot of the whole package still untouched:
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-184 aligncenter" title="Complete view of the package" src="/uploads/2008/08/b1.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="337" /></p></p><p>A second one of the green label:
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-185 aligncenter" title="Green label" src="/uploads/2008/08/b2.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="265" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some of you might think now "A blog post only for this?" but as I said: It is the first package of my life which has been checked by the tax group so it is something special for me :)</p>
