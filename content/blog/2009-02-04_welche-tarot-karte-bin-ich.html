Bei Sari auf <a href="http://www.mondgras.de/sari02/index.php/2009/02/04/ich-bin-der-mond/">Mondgras.de</a> habe ich heute einen Test gesehen, der einem sagen soll, welche Tarot-Karte man ist. Naja das Ergebnis ist irgendwie erschreckend aber die Karte sieht vom Design cool aus :D Den will ich als Hausdrachen...</p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-1195 alignleft" title="The Death" src="/uploads/2009/02/13.jpg" alt="The Death" width="197" height="312" /><strong>You are Death</strong>
Change, Transformation, Alteration.</p><p>People fear this card, but if you want to change your life, this is one of the best indicators for it. Whatever happens, life will be different. Yes, the Death card can signal a death in the right circumstances (a question about a very sick or old relative, for example), but unlike its dramatic presentation in the movies, the Death card is far more likely to signal transformation, passage, change. Scorpio, the sign of this card, has three forms: scorpion, serpent, eagle. The Death card indicates this transition from lower to higher to highest. This is a card of humility, and it may meanyouhavebeenbrought low, but only so that youcan then go higher than ever before. Death "humbles" all, but it also "exults." Always keep in mind that on this card of darkness there is featured a sunrise as well. You could be ready for a change.</p><p><strong>What Tarot Card are You?</strong> <a href="http://www.flarn.com/~warlock/tarot" target="_blank">Take the Test to Find Out.</a>
