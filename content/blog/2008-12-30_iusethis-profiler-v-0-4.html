Just a hour after the last update there is something new again at this script. The search time is decreased to only a few seconds on my system. Also with this improvement the CPU load has decreased while the search is running. The second improvement made in version 0.4 is to search more directories. This will recognize more applications, widgets and preferencePanes installed on your system.</p><p>The new version of the script is available using the already known link:</p><p>Script: <a href="http://github.com/Luzifer/kscripts/tree/master/iusethis_profiler.rb">GitHub</a>
