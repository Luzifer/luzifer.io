Today I changed the domain of my blog from "blog.knutshome.de" to "blog.knut.me" - This is shorter and better to explain to other people while on the phone. The old URL should be removed from the internet soon because it redirects on the new one with a permanent redirect.</p><p>So Google: Please send your spiders!
