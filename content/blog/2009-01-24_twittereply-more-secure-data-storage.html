I've just uploaded a new version of <a href="http://www.twittereply.de">TwitteReply</a> to get more security into the storage of your data. You are still asked to enter your twitter password at the registration but this is only used to verify the given account if yours. After this the password is not stored in the database as before.</p><p>All password which has been kept in the database are deleted now. If you want to get really sure that I don't have your password any more you can change your password at twitter. For all registred users there is no change in the behaviour if the service. As I said your password has been deleted and you will get the next reply even without my script having the password.</p><p>The account verification is kept into the service because I don't want someone to register hundreds of accounts in my service to follow them via mail. If you want to do this please write your own service.
