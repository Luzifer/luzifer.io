## Idea behind this

Anyone doing a Podcast project has different knowledge levels. Most of them are not technical but maybe they want to do live-Podcasts and don't want to care about the technical background. This service is intended to provide a streaming server using Teamspeak 3 and Icecast to let podcasters stream their live-podcast.
