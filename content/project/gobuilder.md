## Idea behind this

This project originated when I was dissatisfied with how other automatic Go building systems were working. I wanted a simple system building my Go code and after that packaging the results with some assets found in the same repository. Also I wanted to have a webhook URL to trigger the builds automatically when my code is pushed to GitHub or BitBucket.
