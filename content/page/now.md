My name is Knut and these are some facts about me and what I'm currently focussing / spending my time on:

- I'm living in [Wedel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedel), a small town near Hamburg, Germany
- I'm working for [About You](https://corporate.aboutyou.de/en/), as an Operations Engineer
- I'm a member of the [volunteer fire department of Wedel](http://www.wedel.de/rathaus-politik/kommunale-betriebe/freiwillige-feuerwehr.html)
- I'm working on [open-source tools](https://knut.in/github) for (home-)automation
- I'm spending some time on [gaming](https://knut.in/steam) and watching films and shows on Netflix
- I'm [listening to music](https://knut.in/lastfm) on [Vox Noctem](http://www.voxnoctem.com/) and [Spotify](https://knut.in/spotify)

If this list changes I'll update this page to the latest state.

_This page is inspired by Derek Sivers and the [/now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about)._
