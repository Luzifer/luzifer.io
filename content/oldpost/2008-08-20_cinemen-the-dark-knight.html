This evening I went to the cinema with two colleagues of my company. The movie to watch was the opening night of "The Dark Knight" and I have to say: A very nice movie!</p><p>If someone thinks about watching it I can only suggest to do so. It is fascinating the whole movie and the actors are great. Of course we watched the german translation of it because it's hard to find a cinema presenting the original english version.
