Today I hopefully increased the number of counted back links found by google while doing a little translation for Brandon Perry from the Ubuntu group of Dallas, TX. He was searching translations for his tutorial regarding his "<a href="http://www.volatileminds.net/projects/clamav/">ClamAV Live CD</a>" (Which I try to support this way) and I wrote the german version of it.</p><p>So if you are reading this and have a native language outside of <a href="http://volatileminds.net/projects/clamav/tutorial.html">english</a> and <a href="http://www.volatileminds.net/projects/clamav/tutorial_de.html">german</a> language please support him too and <a href="http://volatile-minds.blogspot.com/2008/08/translators-needed.html">translate</a> his tutorial for him.
