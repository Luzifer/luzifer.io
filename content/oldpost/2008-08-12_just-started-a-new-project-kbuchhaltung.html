As mentioned in the title I've just started a new project today. This new project was named "KBuchhaltung" which is a combination of the first letter of my name "K" and the german word "Buchhaltung" which means accounting.</p><p>So this project is a little web based application using PHP and MySQL to generate a personal accounting. Just to track where the money is going all the month. This application is not intended to use in a company because it will never get any certificates. I wrote it to know why my money was spent early in the month and I hope by publishing it under GPL that it will be helpfull for other people out there.</p><p>The software is published "as is" and will not be modified much from the current state of development. Most of the changes will address the user interface to get a better usability.</p><p>You can check out the project at the github here: <a href="http://github.com/Luzifer/kbuchhaltung/tree/master">http://github.com/Luzifer/kbuchhaltung/tree/master</a></p><p>If you want to contribute to this project please contact me or send me a patch / bug report / whatever.
