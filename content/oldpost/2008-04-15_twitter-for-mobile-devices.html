On 2nd April there was an interesting <a href="http://shegeeks.net/twobile-twitter-for-windows-mobile/">post</a> on SheGeeks about an mobile application for windows mobile devices to use twitter on it without the cost of many short messages. The only things needed are a windows mobile device with .NET compact framework 2.0 and an internet connection on the mobile.</p><p>So for people like me using such an device (HTC Touch) with a included volume of 250 MB traffic per month this is a nice possibility to post twitter comments on the mobile device and follow the posts of my friends. Additional this works too if the mobile is connected to a WLANaccess-point and helps to reduce cost.</p><p>If you are searching such an client I canrecommendto try out <a href="http://www.infinitumsoftware.com/twobile">this</a> (currently marked as "beta") application.
