Today I released version 0.7 of the iUseThis_Profiler. This new version includes an update checker which keeps you informed about the latest release of the software. So you don't have to check the blog or some other pages for new versions. If there is a new version available you will see a tiny line of text at the top of the script output and can check the repository at GitHub to download it.
[note]The new version of the script is available using the already known link:</p><p>Script: <a href="http://github.com/Luzifer/kscripts/tree/master/iusethis_profiler.rb">GitHub</a>
Changelog: <a href="http://github.com/Luzifer/kscripts/tree/master/iusethis_profiler.rb.changelog">GitHub</a>[/note]
